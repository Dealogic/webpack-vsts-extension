![Add webpack task](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dealogic/webpack-vsts-extension/master/screenshots/TaskCatalogPreview.png)

By default without any configuration the build task is trying to run the locally installed webpack.js from the root folder in the repository with the `--json` flag. For example:
```
node "C:\a\1\s\node_modules\webpack\bin\webpack.js" --json
```

Through the arguments setting additional webpack arguments can be provided. For example:
```
--config webpack.dist.config.js
```

The webpack build errors and warnings are reported under the issues / build section on the summary page:

![webpack build issues](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dealogic/webpack-vsts-extension/master/screenshots/WebpackBuildIssues.png)

The webpack build result section is added onto the summary page to summarize the result:
