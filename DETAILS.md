## <a id="what-the-build-step-does"></a>What The Build Step Does

This build step is using the webpack's command line tool to compile a 'web' application into a bundle. The result, warnings and errors are reported onto the build summary section.

## <a id="usage"></a>Usage

Add the task to your build configuration:

![Add webpack task](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dealogic/webpack-vsts-extension/master/screenshots/TaskCatalog.png)

By default without any configuration the build task is trying to run the locally installed webpack.js from the root folder in the repository and trying to pick up the `webpack.config.js`.

Through the `webpack cli arguments` setting custom arguments can be passed to the webpack cli:

```
-p --display normal
```

Errors and Warnings can be treated differently:
* treat errors as (errors / warnings / info)
* treat warnings as (errors / warnings / info)

Warnings means the task will partially succeed, in case of errors the task will fail. If there are no errors and no warnings, then the task will succeed. You can treat the errors as warnings, so in case of errors, the task will just partially succeed. Or if you would like to ignore the warnings, those should be handled as info.

Errors and Warnings can be reported as pull request comments. Currently only two loaders are supported:
* ts-loader
* tslint-loader

Even general webpack errors and warnings are not supported yet. More support will come!

Don't forget to turn on the following agent phase setting:

![webpack arguments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dealogic/webpack-vsts-extension/master/screenshots/WebpackArguments.png)

The webpack build errors and warnings are reported under the issues / build section on the summary page:

![webpack build issues](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dealogic/webpack-vsts-extension/master/screenshots/WebpackBuildIssues.png)

The webpack build result section is added onto the summary page to summarize the result:

![webpack build result](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dealogic/webpack-vsts-extension/master/screenshots/WebpackBuildResult.png)

### <a id="advanced-settings"></a>Advanced Settings

- Working folder where webpack command is run. If you leave it blank it is the root of the repo.
- Location of the webpack cli. By default it is the locally installed webpack node module in the working folder, e.g. `./node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js`.
- Location of the Stats.js. By default it is the locally installed webpack node module in the working folder, e.g. `./node_modules/webpack/lib/Stats.js`.

![Advanced settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dealogic/webpack-vsts-extension/master/screenshots/AdvancedSettings.png)

### <a id="multiple-build-steps"></a>Multiple Build Steps

Multiple webpack build steps are supported now. To distinguish the webpack build steps on the summary page
and in the list of issues, set the display name properly for the steps:

![Multiple setps with different name](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dealogic/webpack-vsts-extension/master/screenshots/MultipleStepsWithDifferentName.png)

If the webpack projects are not even in the root folder, then don't forget to modify it in the advanced settings like this:

The issues in case of multiple build steps:

The result sections in case of multiple build steps:
